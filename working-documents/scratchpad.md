# Next Steps
1. add a command for allocating funds to a category. maybe 'transfer'?
2. make a nice pretty summary table
3. flesh out the existing commands a little. For example transaction.add needs a bunch more arguments for adding other transaction details

messing about to figure out a nice format for a budget summary table
